<h1>Fraud Detection</h1>
<p>Creation of a fraud detection system for a fictitious bank.</p>
<p>In this project, various machine learning algorithms were used, as well as sophisticated data preprocessing techniques. Hyperparameter tuning was also performed to achieve even more precise and accurate results.</p>
<p>The project is organized into folders called data, notebooks, model, and scripts. Random forest was used as the main algorithm for fraud detection.</p>


The most used technologies are:
